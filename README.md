# Deckpad

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This is a mostly stable prototype, but it is very much alpha!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è After every Steam OS update, make sure to run
> ```
> ~/Deckpad/initialize_after_os_update.sh
> ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** If you quit Deckpad without pressing on the screen (or if it doesn't work on your device), it won't clean up and will prevent sleep and brightness changes!
> - The easiest way way to fix it is to run Deckpad again, and quit it by clicking on the target in the middle of the screen  
> - Alternatively, you can restore the SteamDeck to its original state by running these 2 commands:
>   ```bash
>   sudo chmod 666 /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness
>   sudo systemctl unmask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target >/dev/null 2>&1
>   ```

## What is Deckpad?

Deckpad allows you to use your SteamDeck as a gamepad on your Windows PC.

Once setup, all you have to do is to launch **Deckpad**, enter your password, and it will:

* Connect automatically to your Windows PC and act as a gamepad
   * You can use all the Steam input config you already configured on the SteamDeck
* Reduce the brightness to the minimum
   * Also prevents Steam from raising it while the app is running
* Disable sleep mode while the app is running
* Show the live battery percentage
